# Graph Plotting: Displacement vs. Position and Pressure Fluctuation vs. Position

## Overview
This document explains how to plot a graph of displacement `y` versus position `x`, and a graph of pressure fluctuation `p` versus position `x` at time `t = 0`, using Python.

### Concept
- The displacement `y(x)` is modeled as a sine wave: `y(x) = A * sin(kx)`.
- The pressure fluctuation `p(x)` is modeled as a cosine wave: `p(x) = B * cos(kx)`.
- `A` and `B` represent the amplitudes, and `k` is the wave number.

## Python Code for Plotting
The following Python script uses Matplotlib to plot these functions
